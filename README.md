## Important Notes
- Ensure that the required external tools (e.g., PDF reader) are installed on your system for proper printing.

- If you encounter any issues or errors during the printing process, check the console for error messages.

## Development
- The original Python script (`printer_automated.py`) is included in the project directory. You can modify the script and recompile the executable using your preferred method.
